# MicrostationVBA
A VBA script to automate the editing of elements in **Bentley Microstation CE**

This script will change the color of _all_ elements on a level you specify, with the option to edit line weights as well. 

If used with Batch Process, multiple files can be modified automatically.

CAD best practices with regards to level settings will also be updated, where no elements will be allowed to use custom settings separate to its level's default. Any further changes to the level's settings will _populate through all elements_ on that level.

Additional information on use can be found within the script itself.
